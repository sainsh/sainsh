My name is Thomas Nielsen.<br>
I'm a student at Zealand Academy studying computer science on my 3rd semester.<br>
I'm a somewhat outgoing guy, but I can be a bit awkward at times. <br>
Apart from computers and programming i have a few hobbies, like roleplaying, <br>
both LARP and tabletop. for LARP I attend 2 larger events each year, one late<br>
spring, the other early fall. The event is called LV-live and is a special blend<br>
of roleplay and drinking with groups attending mostly for one or the other <br>
reason. As for tabletop i run my own game with 5 of my friends as players in a <br>
homebrew world, based on a bunch of different weird ideas, where we use the <br>
Pathfinder 1e ruleset, but more on that in the Pathfinder section.<br>
