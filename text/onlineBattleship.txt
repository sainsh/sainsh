Online Battleship

As part of a network project we, a group of 4, decided
to develop an online battleship game in a server/client
pattern. The Sever runs the game and for each 2 clients
that connects to the server a game between the 2 starts
The clients are dumb, they don't have any game logic
which makes the game more secure this one couldn't learn
much from opening up the cient and looking inside. This
also applies to the messages sent between clients and 
server. The messages consists of mostly simple data
types and an array.
We uploaded the source code to github
