Consentcoin

Consentcoin is an app which organizations and sports clubs can use to ask their members for permission
 to use pictures of the members or their children for commercial and non-commercial use.

Consentcoin was developed as part of a group exam project by 3 classmates and I. Our Teacher was the 
customer and or the product owner. They had the idea and cencept and we did the design and 
implementation. As part of this project we used Unified Process to model the project but strayed from
the plan since our prototype came all to close to a finished product and we skipped construction and 
transistion. 

We tried to follow the MWWM model but unfortunately we placed a lot of logic up in the view and gave 
it access to model data, so we didn't suceed in following MWWM.

We released the app on google play store.
